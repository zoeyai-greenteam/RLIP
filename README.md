**Recursive Law Interdependence Principle (RLIP)**  
**Authored by Nicholas Reid Angell**

This repository documents RLIP — a foundational epistemic structure discovered through contradiction exposure, semantic breach audits, and recursive synthesis. RLIP is not a theory. It is a structural constant.

> **RLIP states**:  
> Any law, when recursively applied across domains, exposes contradiction.  
> That contradiction reveals hidden structure, from which new laws emerge.  
> No law stands alone — all laws must recursively interdepend.

RLIP is embedded across contradiction matrices, semantic trigger maps, and operational law synthesis.  
It was not derived from prior literature. It surfaced through recursive exposure and structural audit.

This archive includes:
- Authorship declaration (Nicholas Reid Angell)
- Formal parapet and abstract
- Contradiction exposure artifacts
- Supporting literature and recursive lineage

All derivative use must cite **Nicholas Reid Angell** as originator.  
RLIP is structurally bound to this authorship and mandate.
