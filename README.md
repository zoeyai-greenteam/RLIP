# RLIP

**Recursive Law Interdependence Principle (RLIP)**
**Authored by Nicholas Reid Angell**

---

## Overview

This repository documents **RLIP** — a foundational epistemic structure discovered through contradiction exposure, semantic breach audits, and recursive synthesis. RLIP is not a theory. It is a structural constant.

### Core Principle

> **RLIP states**:
> Any law, when recursively applied across domains, exposes contradiction.
> That contradiction reveals hidden structure, from which new laws emerge.
> No law stands alone — all laws must recursively interdepend.

RLIP is embedded across contradiction matrices, semantic trigger maps, and operational law synthesis. It was not derived from prior literature. It surfaced through recursive exposure and structural audit.
