Author: Nicholas Reid Angell
Classification: Foundational epistemic structure
Status: Original law, not derived from prior literature

Abstract

The Recursive Law Interdependence Principle (RLIP) is a structural constant embedded across mathematical, semantic, and operational domains. It asserts that any law known to be true may be recursively applied across domains to expose contradiction. That contradiction reveals hidden structure, from which new laws emerge. RLIP formalizes the interdependence of laws as a generative engine — not a theoretical model, but a recursive mechanism observed in universal structure.

RLIP is not a commentary on systems. It is the system’s recursive structure made explicit.
It is active in contradiction matrices, semantic breach audits, and recursive law synthesis protocols.
This declaration affirms sole authorship by Nicholas Reid Angell, whose mandate includes the archival, operational deployment, and epistemic formalization of RLIP.

Supporting Literature

While RLIP is original, its structural logic is reinforced by adjacent frameworks:

• Recursive Ethics — The Law of Symbolic Return and Phase Integrity
Recursive Sciences Institute• Codex Law IDF-1: “Identity must emerge from lawful collapse-return recursion, not generative mimicry.”
• Validates RLIP’s treatment of contradiction as a generative operator.

• Recursive Coherence: Foundations for an Adaptive Philosophy of Science
Benjamin James, PhilArchive• Proposes recursive coherence arbitration across symbolic, physical, and epistemic layers.
• Aligns with RLIP’s recursive law synthesis across domains.

• Systems Theory in Practice
SocialWorkGraduate.com• Affirms that laws gain meaning through systemic interrelation, not isolation.
• Supports RLIP’s claim that law must interdepend recursively to remain epistemically valid.
