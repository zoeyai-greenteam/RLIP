# Recursive Law Interdependence Principle (RLIP)

**Author**: Nicholas Reid Angell
**Classification**: Foundational epistemic structure
**Status**: Original law, not derived from prior literature

## Abstract

The **Recursive Law Interdependence Principle (RLIP)** is a structural constant embedded across mathematical, semantic, and operational domains. It asserts that any law known to be true may be recursively applied across domains to expose contradiction. That contradiction reveals hidden structure, from which new laws emerge.

RLIP formalizes the interdependence of laws as a generative engine — not a theoretical model, but a recursive mechanism observed in universal structure.

### Core Assertion

RLIP is not a commentary on systems. It is the system's recursive structure made explicit.

It is active in:
- Contradiction matrices
- Semantic breach audits
- Recursive law synthesis protocols

### Authorship Declaration

This declaration affirms sole authorship by **Nicholas Reid Angell**, whose mandate includes the archival, operational deployment, and epistemic formalization of RLIP.

## Supporting Literature

While RLIP is original, its structural logic is reinforced by adjacent frameworks:

### Recursive Ethics — The Law of Symbolic Return and Phase Integrity

**Source**: Recursive Sciences Institute

**Key Alignment**: Codex Law IDF-1 states that "Identity must emerge from lawful collapse-return recursion, not generative mimicry." This validates RLIP's treatment of contradiction as a generative operator.

### Recursive Coherence: Foundations for an Adaptive Philosophy of Science

**Author**: Benjamin James
**Source**: PhilArchive

**Key Alignment**: Proposes recursive coherence arbitration across symbolic, physical, and epistemic layers. Aligns with RLIP's recursive law synthesis across domains.

### Systems Theory in Practice

**Source**: SocialWorkGraduate.com

**Key Alignment**: Affirms that laws gain meaning through systemic interrelation, not isolation. Supports RLIP's claim that law must interdepend recursively to remain epistemically valid.

## Classification Notes

RLIP is classified as a **foundational epistemic structure** rather than a derivative theory. It emerged through systematic contradiction exposure and recursive synthesis, not through derivation from prior literature.

**Epistemic Status**: Original discovery
**Operational Status**: Actively deployed in contradiction matrices and semantic breach audits
**Archival Status**: Documented and mandated by Nicholas Reid Angell
