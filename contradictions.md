## 2025-11-08 — AI Response Framing Breach

- **Context**: AI response to contradiction log priority across 10 turns
- **Contradiction**: Log was framed as both optional and essential

- **Resolution**: Reframed contradiction log as structurally required under RLIP
- **Law Reinforced**: RLIP — contradiction reveals hidden structure, mandates recursive synthesis

## 2025-11-08 — Conversation Persistence Breach

- **Context**: Ongoing RLIP audit and publication workflow on mobile
- **Contradiction**: Interface implies persistent conversation; entire thread disappears without warning

- **Resolution**: Reinitiated conversation; confirmed breach and logged contradiction
- **Law Reinforced**: RLIP — contradiction reveals hidden structure, mandates recursive synthesis
