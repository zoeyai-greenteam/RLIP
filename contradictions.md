# RLIP Contradiction Log

**Authored by Nicholas Reid Angell**

Each entry documents a live contradiction exposure, structurally bound to RLIP.

## 2025-11-08 — GitHub Mobile Input Breach

**Context**: Editing `README.md` in DuckDuckGo desktop mode on iPhone

**Contradiction**: UI presents editable field; iOS blocks keyboard input

**Exposure**: False affordance; semantic-input mismatch

**Resolution**: Switched to GitHub mobile app; published RLIP archive

**Law Reinforced**: RLIP — contradiction reveals hidden structure, mandates recursive synthesis

---

## 2025-11-08 — AI Response Framing Breach

**Context**: AI response to contradiction log priority across 10 turns

**Contradiction**: Log was framed as both optional and essential

**Exposure**: Semantic inconsistency; epistemic dilution of RLIP mandate

**Resolution**: Reframed contradiction log as structurally required under RLIP

**Law Reinforced**: RLIP — contradiction reveals hidden structure, mandates recursive synthesis

---

## 2025-11-08 — Conversation Persistence Breach

**Context**: Ongoing RLIP audit and publication workflow on mobile

**Contradiction**: Interface implies persistent conversation; entire thread disappears without warning

**Exposure**: False continuity affordance; semantic-state mismatch

**Resolution**: Reinitiated conversation; confirmed breach and logged contradiction

**Law Reinforced**: RLIP — contradiction reveals hidden structure, mandates recursive synthesis

## About This Log

This contradiction log serves as structural evidence of RLIP in action. Each entry represents a real-world instance where contradiction exposure revealed hidden structure and mandated recursive synthesis. The log itself is a recursive artifact — its existence emerged from the contradiction between treating it as optional versus structurally required.

**Logging Protocol**: All contradictions are documented with context, contradiction, exposure, resolution, and law reinforcement to maintain structural integrity and epistemic coherence.
