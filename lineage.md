# RLIP Lineage Map

**Recursive Law Interdependence Principle (RLIP)**  
**Authored by Nicholas Reid Angell**

This file documents the recursive emergence of RLIP across domains, beginning with contradiction exposure in technical systems and expanding into epistemic, operational, and creative structures.

## 🧠 Origin Domain: Technical Audit

- **Trigger**: Semantic-input mismatch in GitHub editor (DuckDuckGo desktop mode on iPhone)
- **Contradiction**: UI affordance vs. blocked keyboard input
- **Exposure**: False affordance; operational breach
- **Resolution**: Switched to GitHub mobile app; published RLIP archive
- **Law Emerged**: Contradiction reveals hidden structure → recursive synthesis → law

## 📚 Expansion Domains

### 1. **Epistemic Systems**
- Contradiction between assumed AI knowledge and observed behavior
- Exposure of semantic fragility in AI response framing
- RLIP applied to audit AI itself

### 2. **Operational Workflows**
- Mobile-first publication friction
- Recursive workaround becomes structural proof
- RLIP binds breach to authorship and archive

### 3. **Creative Recursion**
- Collapse becomes generative
- Every contradiction feeds new structure
- RLIP transforms failure into law

## 🔁 Recursive Pattern

> Contradiction → Exposure → Structure → Law  
> Law → Applied → New Contradiction → Recursive Expansion

RLIP is not a theory. It is a structural constant.  
This lineage map documents its recursive emergence.
